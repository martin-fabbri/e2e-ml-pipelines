# Automating End-to-End Machine Learning Pipelines

This repository explores different approaches to automate the end-to-end flow of machine learning powered applications. One of our goals is to leverage the existing principles and practices of Continous Delivery to machine learning uses cases.

Machine Learning applications are becoming popular in our industry. However, the process for developing, deploying, and continuously improving them is more complex compared to more traditional software, such as a web service or a mobile application. They are subject to change in three axes: the code itself, the model, and the data. Their behavior is often complex and hard to predict, and they are harder to test, harder to explain, and harder to improve.
